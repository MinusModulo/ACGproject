## How to build

We recommend using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) as the IDE for building this project.

### Step 0: Prerequisites

- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg): The C++ package manager. Clone the vcpkg repo to anywhere you like, we will refer tha vcpkg path as
  `<VCPKG_ROOT>` in the following instructions (the path ends in `vcpkg`, not its parent directory).
- [MSVC with Windows SDK (version 10+)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/): We usually install this via Visual Studio installer. You should select the following workloads during installation:
  - Desktop development with C++

  Then everything should be installed automatically.
- [[optional] Python3](https://python.org): We provide python package with pybind11. Such functionality requires Python3 installation. You may install anywhere you like (System-wide, User-only, Conda, Homebrew, etc.). We will refer the python executable path as `<PYTHON_EXECUTABLE_PATH>` in the following instructions.
- [[optional] Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home): Vulkan is the latest cross-platform graphics API. Since D3D12 is available on Windows, this is optional. Install the SDK [Caution: not the Runtime (RT)] via the official **SDK installer**. You should be able to run `vulkaninfo` command in a new terminal after installation. **No optional components are needed for this project**.
- [[optional] CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads): CUDA is optional, however, some functions such as most of the GPU-accelerated physics simulation features will require CUDA. Install the toolkit with the official **exe (local)** installer. You should be able to run `nvcc --version` command in a new terminal after installation.

- ### Step 1: Clone the repo

- Clone this repo with submodules:
  ```bash
  git clone --recurse-submodules
  ```
  or
- Clone without submodules:
  ```bash
  git clone <this-repo-url>
  ```
  Then initialize and update the submodules (in the root directory of this repo):
  ```bash
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

### Step 2: CMake Configuration

In Visual Studio, open the `Project` -> `CMake Settings for Project` menu, and modify the `CMake toolchain file` to: `<VCPKG_ROOT>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`.

In this process, the CMake script will check whether you have installed Vulkan SDK and CUDA Toolkit, and configure the build options accordingly.

### Step 3: Build and Run

Now you can build and run the project in Visual Studio as usual, selecting the desired target (`ShortMarchDemo.exe` for the demo we provided).

## Bug Shooting

### CMake Configuration Issues

Make sure that you have set the `CMake toolchain file` correctly to `<VCPKG_ROOT>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`. After any change to the configuration, remember to clean the CMake cache (via `Project` -> `CMake Cache` -> `Delete Cache and Reconfigure` menu in Visual Studio) and reconfigure the project.

### Vulkan Validation Layer Error

If you encounter the following error when running the application:
```
validation layer (ERROR): loader_get_json: Failed to open JSON file </path/to/a/json>
```
where `/path/to/a/json` is a non-existent file, it indicates that the Vulkan validation layers are trying to load a configuration file that does not exist on your system. Hopefully, the </path/to/a/json> is related to your Steam or Epic Games installation. To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:
1. Press `Win + R` and type `regedit` to open the Registry Editor.
2. Try to find the `</path/to/a/json>` under:
	- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\ImplicitLayers`
	- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\ExplicitLayers`
	- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\ImplicitLayers`
	- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\ExplicitLayers`.
3. Delete the entry that points to the non-existent JSON file and restart your program.

## Getting Started with the Ray Tracing Demo

The `src/` directory contains a minimalistic interactive ray tracing demo that showcases hardware-accelerated ray tracing using the LongMarch framework. This demo features a scene-based architecture with entity management, interactive camera controls, and an ImGui-based inspection interface.

In your own project, you could either start from this demo or build from scratch. You could modify any file in the `src/` directory to fit your needs.

### Project Structure

```
src/
├── main.cpp              # Application entry point
├── app.h/app.cpp         # Main application class with rendering loop
├── Scene.h/Scene.cpp     # Scene manager (TLAS, materials buffer)
├── Entity.h/Entity.cpp   # Entity class (mesh, BLAS, transform)
├── Film.h/Film.cpp       # Film class for progressive accumulation

└── shaders/
    └── shader.hlsl       # Ray tracing shaders (raygen, miss, closest hit)
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Scene-Based Architecture
- **Scene Management**: The `Scene` class manages multiple entities and builds the Top-Level Acceleration Structure (TLAS)
- **Entity System**: Each `Entity` contains a mesh (loaded from `.obj` files), a material, and a transform matrix
- **Materials**: Simple PBR materials with base color, roughness, and metallic properties

#### 2. Interactive Camera Controls
The demo supports two modes:
- **Camera Mode** (right-click to enable):
  - `W/A/S/D` - Move forward/left/backward/right
  - `Space/Shift` - Move up/down
  - Mouse - Look around (cursor hidden)
  
- **Inspection Mode** (right-click to disable camera):
  - Mouse - Hover over entities to highlight them
  - Left-click - Select entity for detailed inspection
  - UI panels display camera, scene, and entity information

#### 3. Entity Highlighting and Selection
- **Pixel-Perfect Picking**: Uses a GPU-rendered entity ID buffer for accurate entity detection under the cursor
- **Hover Highlighting**: Entities glow yellow when the cursor hovers over them
- **Click Selection**: Left-click on an entity to select it and view details in the right panel

#### 4. Progressive Accumulation (Film Class)
- **Automatic Accumulation**: When camera is stationary (camera mode disabled), samples accumulate over time
- **High-Quality Rendering**: Progressive refinement produces noise-free images with more samples
- **Smart Reset**: Accumulation automatically resets when camera movement stops
- **Real-time Feedback**: Sample count displayed in UI shows accumulation progress

#### 5. Pixel Inspector
- **Real-time Color Sampling**: Shows RGB values of the pixel under the cursor
- **Original Color Display**: Values shown are before highlighting is applied (matches saved screenshots)
- **Multiple Formats**: Both normalized float (0.0-1.0) and 8-bit (0-255) values
- **Color Preview**: Visual color swatch shows the exact pixel color
- **Mouse Position**: Displays current cursor coordinates

#### 6. Screenshot Capture
- **Ctrl+S Shortcut**: Save accumulated output as PNG image
- **Automatic Naming**: Timestamped filenames (e.g., `screenshot_20251101_225009.png`)
- **Full Path Logging**: Console shows complete absolute path where image is saved
- **Pure Rendering**: Saved images exclude UI overlays and hover highlights
- **High Quality**: Captures the fully accumulated, noise-free render

#### 7. ImGui Interface
Two non-collapsible panels appear in inspection mode:
- **Left Panel** (Scene Information):
  - Camera position, direction, yaw, pitch
  - Speed and sensitivity settings
  - Entity count, material count, total triangles
  - Hovered and selected entity IDs
  - **Pixel Inspector**: Mouse position and RGB color values
  - Render information (resolution, backend, device)
  - Accumulation status and sample count
  - Controls hint
  
- **Right Panel** (Entity Inspector):
  - Dropdown to select any entity
  - Transform information (position, scale)
  - Material properties (base color, roughness, metallic)
  - Mesh statistics (triangles, vertices, indices)
  - BLAS build status

### How to Use

   - Or use the dropdown menu to select entities manually

4. **Inspect Pixels**:
   - Hover over any part of the rendered image
   - View RGB color values in the Pixel Inspector section
   - Values shown are the original rendered colors (before highlighting)

5. **Hide UI** (inspection mode only):
   - Hold **Tab** key to temporarily hide all UI panels
   - Useful for taking clean screenshots or viewing full render

6. **Save Screenshots**:
   - Press **Ctrl+S** to save the current accumulated output as PNG
   - Images saved with timestamp in filename
   - Console shows full path where image is saved
   - Saved images are clean (no UI, no highlights)

### Code Architecture

#### Application Class (`app.h/app.cpp`)
The main application class manages:
- Graphics core initialization (D3D12 or Vulkan)
- Window creation and event handling
- Camera state and controls
- Scene rendering and entity interaction
- ImGui interface rendering

Key methods:
- `OnInit()` - Initialize graphics, create scene, load entities
- `OnUpdate()` - Process input, update hover detection, upload GPU buffers
- `OnRender()` - Execute ray tracing, apply post-process highlighting, render ImGui overlays
- `OnClose()` - Clean up resources
- `UpdateHoveredEntity()` - GPU-based entity ID and pixel color readback for accurate picking
- `ApplyHoverHighlight()` - Post-process highlighting applied after accumulation
- `SaveAccumulatedOutput()` - Save clean accumulated render to PNG file

#### Scene Class (`Scene.h/Scene.cpp`)
Manages the scene graph:
- `AddEntity()` - Add entities to the scene
- `BuildAccelerationStructures()` - Build TLAS from all entity BLAS
- `UpdateMaterialsBuffer()` - Upload materials to GPU
- `GetTLAS()` - Get the acceleration structure for rendering

#### Entity Class (`Entity.h/Entity.cpp`)
Represents individual objects:
- `LoadMesh()` - Load geometry from `.obj` files
- `BuildBLAS()` - Create Bottom-Level Acceleration Structure
- Material and transform properties

#### Film Class (`Film.h/Film.cpp`)
Manages progressive sample accumulation:
- `Reset()` - Clear accumulated samples (called when camera stops moving)
- `IncrementSampleCount()` - Track the number of accumulated samples
- `DevelopToOutput()` - Average accumulated colors and output final image
- `Resize()` - Handle window resize events
- Internal buffers for accumulated color and sample counts

#### Shader (`shaders/shader.hlsl`)
HLSL ray tracing shaders:
- `RayGenMain` - Generate primary rays from camera, accumulate samples to film buffers, write entity IDs
- `MissMain` - Sky gradient for missed rays
- `ClosestHitMain` - Shading with material properties (highlighting done in post-process)
- Writes to multiple outputs: color, entity ID, and accumulation buffers

### Adding New Entities

To add new objects to the scene, edit `Application::OnInit()` in `app.cpp`:

```cpp
// Example: Add a new red sphere
auto red_sphere = std::make_shared<Entity>(
    "meshes/preview_sphere.obj",                    // Mesh path
    Material(glm::vec3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), 0.3f, 0.0f),  // Red, smooth, non-metallic
    glm::translate(glm::mat4(1.0f), glm::vec3(3.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f))  // Position
);
scene_->AddEntity(red_sphere);
```

After adding entities, remember to call `scene_->BuildAccelerationStructures()`.

### Customizing Materials

Materials use a simple PBR model:
```cpp
Material(
    glm::vec3(r, g, b),  // Base color (0.0 to 1.0)
    roughness,            // Surface roughness (0.0 = smooth, 1.0 = rough)
    metallic              // Metallic factor (0.0 = dielectric, 1.0 = metal)
);
```

### Technical Details

- **Acceleration Structures**: Uses hardware ray tracing with BLAS per entity and a single TLAS
- **Resource Bindings**:
  - Space 0: Acceleration Structure (TLAS)
  - Space 1: Output image (UAV) - immediate rendering output
  - Space 2: Camera info (constant buffer)
  - Space 3: Materials (structured buffer)
  - Space 4: Hover info (constant buffer)
  - Space 5: Entity ID output (UAV) - for pixel-perfect entity picking
  - Space 6: Accumulated color (UAV) - progressive accumulation buffer
  - Space 7: Accumulated samples (UAV) - sample count per pixel
- **Dual Output Mode**: 
  - Camera enabled: Shows immediate render output from space1
  - Camera disabled: Shows accumulated/averaged output for progressive refinement
- **Entity Picking**: Uses GPU-rendered ID buffer (space5) for pixel-perfect cursor-based entity selection
- **Post-Process Highlighting**: Hover highlights applied after accumulation, ensuring clean saved screenshots

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key Combination | Action | Mode |
|----------------|--------|------|
| **Right Click** | Toggle camera mode on/off | Any |
| **W/A/S/D** | Move camera forward/left/backward/right | Camera mode |
| **Space** | Move camera up | Camera mode |
| **Shift** | Move camera down | Camera mode |
| **Mouse** | Look around | Camera mode |
| **Left Click** | Select hovered entity | Inspection mode |
| **Tab** (hold) | Hide UI panels | Inspection mode |
| **Ctrl+S** | Save screenshot as PNG | Inspection mode |

### Performance Considerations

- **GPU Readback**: Entity ID and pixel color picking use synchronous GPU readback which may cause minor stalls
- **CPU-side Film Development**: The `DevelopToOutput()` method currently runs on CPU; consider implementing a compute shader for better performance
- **CPU-side Post-Highlighting**: The `ApplyHoverHighlight()` method downloads and uploads full images each frame when hovering
- **Sample Accumulation**: Accumulation happens in the shader every frame; when camera is moving, these writes are unused overhead

### Known Limitations

- **Simple Lighting**: Placeholder normal (up vector) for diffuse shading
- **No Anti-aliasing**: Single sample per pixel per frame (can be improved with jittered sampling)
- **Static Scenes**: Animation requires manual `UpdateInstances()` calls
- **Single Window**: ImGui context supports only one window at a time
- **No Tone Mapping**: Accumulated colors are directly averaged without tone mapping or exposure control
- **Performance Overhead**: Post-process highlighting and pixel inspector use full-image GPU readbacks
